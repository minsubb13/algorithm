# My Algorithm Study Repository

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various algorithm problems and my notes on data structures and algorithms.

## 🌳 Directory Structure

- **`/problem-solving`**: Contains solutions for problems from online judges.
  - `baekjoon/`: Solutions for Baekjoon Online Judge.
  - `swea/`: Solutions for SW Expert Academy.
- **`/concepts`**: Code written while studying specific algorithms or data structures.
- **`/utils`**: Utility functions used across different files.

## ✍️ How to Use

Each file is named according to the problem number or concept it represents. You can compile and run each file individually.

Example (for C++):
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -Wall a.cc -o ../../build/a
./a
```
